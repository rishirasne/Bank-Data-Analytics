🏦 Bank Data Analytics Project
Tools Used: Excel, Power BI, SQL (MySQL/SQL Server), Tableau
Dataset Size: 100,000+ records (real-world banking data from two datasets: loan and transaction data)

📁 Project Overview:
This project involved analyzing banking data across two key domains:

Loan Disbursement & Collection Data (from bank_data)

Customer Transaction Data (from credit_and_debit)

The goal was to build a 360° view of banking operations, including customer behavior, branch performance, credit risk, and financial KPIs, using visual dashboards and SQL analytics.

📊 What You Did (Key Tasks)
1. 🔍 Data Cleaning and Preparation
Used Excel to inspect and clean raw data: handled null values, corrected formats, standardized fields.

Performed initial exploratory analysis: loan status counts, age distributions, branch totals.

2. 🧠 SQL-Based Data Analysis
Wrote queries, subqueries, stored procedures, views, and triggers to:

Calculate total loan amounts, collections, interest revenue.

Derive loan default rates and delinquent borrower trends.

Group and compare data by region, state, product type, age group, religion, and loan status.

Built reusable views for dashboards (e.g., branch-wise revenue, credit-to-debit ratio).

3. 📈 Power BI Dashboard
Created interactive dashboards with slicers and visuals like:

Loan Distribution by State, Product, and Customer Age Group

Branch-Wise Revenue and Growth

Loan Status Breakdown (Active, Closed, Defaulted)

Disbursement Trends over Time

Enabled dynamic filtering by year, branch, or loan type.

4. 📊 Tableau Dashboard
Built dashboards for transaction data:

Credit vs. Debit Volume by Bank and Branch

High-risk transaction flagging (e.g., > ₹100,000)

Transaction Method Distribution (Card, Transfer, etc.)

Monthly transaction volume trends

5. 📌 KPIs Tracked
Total Funded Loan Amount

Total Collection and Interest Earned

Credit-to-Debit Ratio

Net Transaction Amount

Default and Delinquency Rates

Verified vs. Unverified Loans

Account Activity Ratio

🚀 Outcome / Impact
Produced a centralized reporting system that helps:

Track branch and customer performance

Detect fraud or risky transactions

Monitor lending effectiveness and repayment behavior

Demonstrated your ability to handle large datasets and translate them into business insights using modern BI tools.
